There is nothing but myself, what can frighten me? This is to be heard day after day. Get rid of all other thoughts.

It eats you out and leaves you crying in the darkness, so simple a phrase like 'maybe we should be just friends' turns into a glass splinter working its way into your heart. It hurts. Not just in the imagination. Not just in the mind. It's a soul-hurt, a real gets-inside-you-and-rips-you-apart pain. I hate love". Neil Gaiman

- üDesign is a funny word. Some people think design means how it looks. But of course, if you dig deeper, itùs really how it works. The design of the Mac wasnùt what it looked like, although that was part of it. Primarily, it was how it worked. To design something really well, you have to get it. You have to really grok what itùs all about. It takes a passionate commitment to really thoroughly understand something, chew it up, not just quickly swallow it. Most people donùt take the time to do that. - Steve Jobs
- üCreativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didnùt really do it, they just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after a while. Thatùs because they were able to connect experiences theyùve had and synthesize new things. And the reason they were able to do that was that theyùve had more experiences or they have thought more about their experiences than other people. - Steve Jobs
- üUnfortunately, thatùs too rare a commodity. A lot of people in our industry havenùt had very diverse experiences. So they donùt have enough dots to connect, and they end up with very linear solutions without a broad perspective on the problem. The broader oneùs understanding of the human experience, the better design we will have. - Steve Jobs

But the networks are really in business to give people what they want. Itùs the truth.ý [Wired, February 1996] - Steve Jobs

- "The key to non-anxious sermon-writing is that itùs not about me. Itùs about the congregation. I honor the fact that the listeners bring more to the sermon than I do.

- You can have an easy life or an awesome one. Choose wisely.Everything you desire in life has a price and you have to be willing to accept that price. If you desire to do great work, it will cost you. Likewise, security and comfort will cost you. If you want a luxury apartment with a wrap-around sectional couch in leather with stainless steel legs, it will cost you.  But hereâ€™s the thing: Iâ€™d rather be exhausted striving for excellence than churning out work that succeeds merely because it offends the least amount of people. The cost? The fear of financial uncertainty. But I willingly accept this cost because it allows me to follow my path and craft the type of career and lifestyle that I want and need. There are things that I will not compromise on, including my sanity, happiness, time with my family, spontaneous travel with my son, and creative control in the work I choose to take on. If I fail, I will fail on my own terms, doing what I love.
- "It is the very pursuit of happiness that thwarts happiness."
- "that life had no intrinsic meaning, any more than a piece of music had an intrinsic â€˜pointâ€™. Life was, in Zen parlance, yugen â€” a kind of elevated purposelessness."
- " Zen, more than anything else, is about reclaiming and expanding the present moment. "
- The first principle of Zen, voiced by the philosopher Lao Tzu, is â€˜Those who know donâ€™t say, and those who say donâ€™t know.â€™ 
-The emphasis on the present moment is perhaps Zenâ€™s most distinctive characteristic. In our Western relationship with time, in which we compulsively pick over the past in order to learn lessons from it and then project into a hypothetical future in which those lessons can be applied, the present moment has been compressed to a tiny sliver on the clock face between a vast past and an infinite future. Zen, more than anything else, is about reclaiming and expanding the present moment.
